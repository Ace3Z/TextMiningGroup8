    "This notebook describes the LAB-3 assignment of the Text Mining course. It is about sentiment analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "The aims of the assignment are:\n",
    "* Learn how to run a rule-based sentiment analysis module (VADER)\n",
    "* Learn how to run a machine learning sentiment analysis module (Scikit-Learn/ Naive Bayes)\n",
    "* Learn how to run scikit-learn metrics for the quantitative evaluation\n",
    "* Learn how to perform and interpret a quantitative evaluation of the outcomes of the tools (in terms of Precision, Recall, and F<sub>1</sub>)\n",
    "* Learn how to evaluate the results qualitatively (by examining the data) \n",
    "* Get insight into differences between the two applied methods\n",
    "* Get insight into the effects of using linguistic preprocessing\n",
    "* Be able to describe differences between the two methods in terms of their results\n",
    "* Get insight into issues when applying these methods across different  domains\n",
    "\n",
    "In this assignment, you are going to create your own gold standard set from 50 tweets. You will the VADER and scikit-learn classifiers to these tweets and evaluate the results by using evaluation metrics and inspecting the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "We recommend you go through the notebooks in the following order:\n",
    "* **Read the assignment (see below)**\n",
    "* **Lab3.2-Sentiment-analysis-with-VADER.ipynb**\n",
    "* **Lab3.3-Sentiment-analysis.with-scikit-learn.ipynb**\n",
    "* **Answer the questions of the assignment (see below) using the provided notebooks and submit**\n",
    "\n",
    "In this assignment you are asked to perform both quantitative evaluations and error analyses:\n",
    "* a quantitative evaluation concerns the scores (Precision, Recall, and F<sub>1</sub>) provided by scikit's classification_report. It includes the scores per category, as well as micro and macro averages. Discuss whether the scores are balanced or not between the different categories (positive, negative, neutral) and between precision and recall. Discuss the shortcomings (if any) of the classifier based on these scores\n",
    "* an error analysis regarding the misclassifications of the classifier. It involves going through the texts and trying to understand what has gone wrong. It servers to get insight in what could be done to improve the performance of the classifier. Do you observe patterns in misclassifications?  Discuss why these errors are made and propose ways to solve them."

    "## Sentence 1: \"I love apples\"\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:**  \n",
    "In this sentence, VADER identifies the word \"love\" as strongly positive. The remaining words (\"I\" and \"apples\") are not associated with any sentiment in the lexicon. So, the overall sentiment is driven almost completely by \"love,\" resulting in a high positive score.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Sentence 2: \"I don't love apples\"\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:**  \n",
    "The presence of the negation \"don't\" inverts the sentiment of the word \"love.\" VADER’s negation rule switches the polarity of a positive term to negative, leading to an overall negative sentiment for the sentence. This shows how even a single negator can significantly change the sentiment outcome.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Sentence 3: \"I love apples :-)\"\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:**  \n",
    "The positive term \"love\" is again present, and the additional emoticon \":-)\" provides an extra boost. VADER is designed to recognize common emoticons and assign them sentiment values. The combination results in an even higher overall positive sentiment than the sentence without the emoticon.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Sentence 4: \"These houses are ruins\"\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:**  \n",
    "The key term in this sentence is \"ruins,\" which in VADER’s lexicon carries a negative connotation. As a result, the sentence is interpreted as negative. However, the context is unknown, “ruins” could describe old structures as well but VADER does not perform context disambiguation, so it relies solely on the lexicon value.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Sentence 5: \"These houses are certainly not considered ruins\"\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:**  \n",
    "In this sentence, the negative word \"ruins\" is modified by the negation \"not,\" which causes VADER to invert its sentiment. Additionally, the modifier \"certainly\" slightly improves the sentiment intensity. The inversion of a negative term leads VADER to interpret the sentence as leaning towards a positive sentiment, even though one might expect it to be more neutral.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Sentence 6: \"He lies in the chair in the garden\"\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:**  \n",
    "The word \"lies\" is ambiguous. Although it can mean \"reclines\" in a neutral sense, VADER’s lexicon associates \"lies\" with dishonesty, a negative trait. Without the ability to disambiguate between the meanings, VADER assigns a negative sentiment to the sentence, even though the intended meaning is simply descriptive (and, thus, one would be expect the sentiment to be neutral).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Sentence 7: \"This house is like any house\"\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:**  \n",
    "In this case, the word \"like\" is interpreted by VADER as a positive signal. However, the sentence is meant to express a neutral comparison, that the house is unremarkable. Because VADER registers \"like\" with a positive bias, it results in a slight positive sentiment, which does not fully capture the neutral intent of the sentence.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Final Outcome:**  \n",
    "VADER’s approach relies on a fixed lexicon and a set of heuristic rules. While it effectively captures clear positive and negative signals (handles negation and emoticons), its inability to disambiguate word meanings or interpret subtle contextual cues can lead to sentiment scores that do not always match the intended sentiment of the sentence.\n"

    "1. **Precision** (how many tweets did VADER classify correctly out of all classifications for a certain category):\n",
    "* Negative (`1.00`) - VADER achieves perfect precision on negative examples (correctly predicts them 100% of the time)\n",
    "* Neutral (`0.75`) - some tweets misclassified as neutral were actually positive or negative\n",
    "* Positive (`0.82`) - overall high precision on positive tweets, however, *18%* of those classified as positive are being misclassified\n",
    "2. **Recall** (how many tweets did VADER classify correctly out of all the tweets in a category (as determined by the gold label)):\n",
    "* Negative (`0.75`) - some negative tweets were misclassified as neutral or positive\n",
    "* Neutral (`0.75`) - VADER manages to identify *75%* of actual neutral tweets\n",
    "* Positive (`1.00`) - all actual positive tweets were detected correctly\n",
    "3. **F1-score** (harmonic mean of precision and recall):\n",
    "* Negative (`0.86`) - strong performance in detecting negative tweets\n",
    "* Neutral (`0.75`) - decent performance in classifying neutral tweets. Across the three categories, VADER has the lowest score for neutral tweets\n",
    "* Positive (`0.90`) - highly effective at identifying positive tweets\n",
    "4. **Accuracy** (overall percentage of correct classifications):\n",
    "* `84%` - VADER correctly classified *84%* of all tweets\n",
    "5. **Macro average** & **Weighted average**                  ## Add micro avg and add and discuss the numbers perhaps?\n",
    "* Macro average - the average of precision, recall, and F1-score across all classes, treating each class equally (no weights)\n",
    "* Weighted average - the average of precision, recall, and F1-score, weighted by the number of samples in each class\n",
    "* Both macro and weighted averages showed nearly identical scores\n",
    "\n",
    "For evaluating the overall performance, F1-scores and accuracy are most relevant as they give a good general idea of how well the classifier works. Accuracy alone can be a misleading metric, as it does not give insight on the types of errors the model makes and is sensitive to class imbalance - when one category is much more frequent that the rest (this is not the case here), therefore, combining it with F1-score, we can get a good overview of the performance."

    "#### **(B) Error Analysis**\n",
    "In total, 0 positive tweets were misclassified, 4 negative tweets were misclassified as neutral, and 4 neutral were misclassified as positive.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Misclassified Positive Tweets\n",
    "* All true-positive tweets are correctly identified.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Misclassified Negative Tweets\n",
    "* All 4 true-negative tweets were misclassified as neutral. In all of them, we see that the `neu` score is 1.0, meaning that the classifier is absolutely sure the tweets convey a neutral tone. Therefore, its lexicon fails to associate the negative words in the sentence with a negative sentiment. For example, the tweet `\"The traffic today was unbearable. Took me whole two hours to get home.\"` clearly carries a negative sentiment, because of the word `unbearable`, which seems to be missing from VARDER's lexicon, possibly accounting for the fact that it classified the tweet as `neutral`. Similarly, the words `cold` and `tasteless` from the second tweet `\"The food at the restaurant was cold and tasteless. Never going back.\"` are also absent from VADER's lexicon, which leads to a misclassification as neutral despite the negative sentiment. The words `slow` and `cold` (again) indicating a negative sentiment in the third tweet `\"The service at the cafe was slow and the coffee was cold.\"` are missing as well, contributing to its neutral classification. Lastly, the terms `overpriced` and `mediocre` from the fourth tweet `\"The restaurant was overpriced and the food was mediocre.\"` are not found in VADER's lexicon, which likely resulted in the neutral classification of the tweet, even though it expresses a negative tone.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Misclassified Neutral Tweets\n",
    "* As shown in the performance analysis, the classifier has the lowest performance score when it comes to neutral tweets. All 4 of the misclassified neutral tweets were classified as positive, suggesting that VADER tends to assign a sentiment even when the intended tone is neutral. A common issue observed is that VADER overweights slightly positive words, such as `innovation`, `exploration`, `useful`, and `like`. These words do not necessarily indicate strong positive emotion, but VADER assigns them a positive sentiment score. For example, in For example, in `\"Reading about the latest tech innovations. There have been a lot of new developments.\"`, the word `innovations` is factual rather than an expression of enthusiasm, yet it leads to a positive classification. The same is true for the word `exploration` in `\"Listening to a podcast about space exploration. So much new information...\"`, which also causes a misclassification. Moreover, VADER lacks context awareness, causing misinterpretations of the tone. In `\"Would you like to watch the sunset at the park with me tonight?\"`, the phrase `would you like` is not an expression of excitement but rather a neutral request, yet VADER assigns it a positive connotation. Similarly, in `\"Listening to a podcast about productivity. It provides many useful tips.\"`, the word `useful` describes a fact rather than carrying a positive sentiment, yet it considers the tweet to be positive.\n",
    "* In addition to the points made above, another possible reason for the observed misclassifications is that the threshold for classifying a tweet as positive is too lenient. Currently, any `compound` score greater than `0.0` results in a positive classification, even if the score is barely a positive number. This means that tweets with weakly positive words, even if the intended tone is neutral, are pushed towards the positive category. Raising the threshold slightly could help reduce these errors and better differentiate between truly neutral and positive tweets."

    "Some unexpected features appeared in the output, such as punctuation and symbols like `\"@\"`, `\".\"`, `\"!\"`, `\"?\"`, and `\"#\"`, which are structural elements of tweets but do not carry sentiment. Additionally, common stopwords such as `\"the\"`, `\"a\"`, `\"is\"`, `\"with\"`, and `\"that\"` were surprisingly ranked high despite being function words that frequently appear in all tweets without having meaningful sentiment. Furthermore, numbers and generic words like `\"2\"`, `\"hours\"`, and `\"http\"` were unexpected. While `\"hour\"` and `\"hours\"` may sometimes indicate delays, numerical values and URLs generally do not convey sentiment on their own.\n",

    "1. **Remove Stopwords**: Use `stop_words=\"english\"` in `CountVectorizer` to filter out common words that don’t add meaning.  \n",
    "2. **Exclude Punctuation** \n",
    "4. **Apply Stemming or Lemmatization**: Convert words to their root form (e.g., `\"delayed\"` → `\"delay\"`, `\"cancelled\"` → `\"cancel\"`).  \n",
    "\n",
