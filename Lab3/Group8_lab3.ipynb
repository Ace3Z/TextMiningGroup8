    "This notebook describes the LAB-3 assignment of the Text Mining course. It is about sentiment analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "The aims of the assignment are:\n",
    "* Learn how to run a rule-based sentiment analysis module (VADER)\n",
    "* Learn how to run a machine learning sentiment analysis module (Scikit-Learn/ Naive Bayes)\n",
    "* Learn how to run scikit-learn metrics for the quantitative evaluation\n",
    "* Learn how to perform and interpret a quantitative evaluation of the outcomes of the tools (in terms of Precision, Recall, and F<sub>1</sub>)\n",
    "* Learn how to evaluate the results qualitatively (by examining the data) \n",
    "* Get insight into differences between the two applied methods\n",
    "* Get insight into the effects of using linguistic preprocessing\n",
    "* Be able to describe differences between the two methods in terms of their results\n",
    "* Get insight into issues when applying these methods across different  domains\n",
    "\n",
    "In this assignment, you are going to create your own gold standard set from 50 tweets. You will the VADER and scikit-learn classifiers to these tweets and evaluate the results by using evaluation metrics and inspecting the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "We recommend you go through the notebooks in the following order:\n",
    "* **Read the assignment (see below)**\n",
    "* **Lab3.2-Sentiment-analysis-with-VADER.ipynb**\n",
    "* **Lab3.3-Sentiment-analysis.with-scikit-learn.ipynb**\n",
    "* **Answer the questions of the assignment (see below) using the provided notebooks and submit**\n",
    "\n",
    "In this assignment you are asked to perform both quantitative evaluations and error analyses:\n",
    "* a quantitative evaluation concerns the scores (Precision, Recall, and F<sub>1</sub>) provided by scikit's classification_report. It includes the scores per category, as well as micro and macro averages. Discuss whether the scores are balanced or not between the different categories (positive, negative, neutral) and between precision and recall. Discuss the shortcomings (if any) of the classifier based on these scores\n",
    "* an error analysis regarding the misclassifications of the classifier. It involves going through the texts and trying to understand what has gone wrong. It servers to get insight in what could be done to improve the performance of the classifier. Do you observe patterns in misclassifications?  Discuss why these errors are made and propose ways to solve them."

    "## Sentence 1: \"I love apples\"\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:**  \n",
    "In this sentence, VADER identifies the word \"love\" as strongly positive. The remaining words (\"I\" and \"apples\") are not associated with any sentiment in the lexicon. So, the overall sentiment is driven almost completely by \"love,\" resulting in a high positive score.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Sentence 2: \"I don't love apples\"\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:**  \n",
    "The presence of the negation \"don't\" inverts the sentiment of the word \"love.\" VADER’s negation rule switches the polarity of a positive term to negative, leading to an overall negative sentiment for the sentence. This shows how even a single negator can significantly change the sentiment outcome.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Sentence 3: \"I love apples :-)\"\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:**  \n",
    "The positive term \"love\" is again present, and the additional emoticon \":-)\" provides an extra boost. VADER is designed to recognize common emoticons and assign them sentiment values. The combination results in an even higher overall positive sentiment than the sentence without the emoticon.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Sentence 4: \"These houses are ruins\"\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:**  \n",
    "The key term in this sentence is \"ruins,\" which in VADER’s lexicon carries a negative connotation. As a result, the sentence is interpreted as negative. However, the context is unknown, “ruins” could describe old structures as well but VADER does not perform context disambiguation, so it relies solely on the lexicon value.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Sentence 5: \"These houses are certainly not considered ruins\"\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:**  \n",
    "In this sentence, the negative word \"ruins\" is modified by the negation \"not,\" which causes VADER to invert its sentiment. Additionally, the modifier \"certainly\" slightly improves the sentiment intensity. The inversion of a negative term leads VADER to interpret the sentence as leaning towards a positive sentiment, even though one might expect it to be more neutral.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Sentence 6: \"He lies in the chair in the garden\"\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:**  \n",
    "The word \"lies\" is ambiguous. Although it can mean \"reclines\" in a neutral sense, VADER’s lexicon associates \"lies\" with dishonesty, a negative trait. Without the ability to disambiguate between the meanings, VADER assigns a negative sentiment to the sentence, even though the intended meaning is simply descriptive.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Sentence 7: \"This house is like any house\"\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:**  \n",
    "In this case, the word \"like\" is interpreted by VADER as a positive signal. However, the sentence is meant to express a neutral comparison, that the house is unremarkable. Because VADER registers \"like\" with a positive bias, it results in a slight positive sentiment, which does not fully capture the neutral intent of the sentence.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Final Outcome:**  \n",
    "VADER’s approach relies on a fixed lexicon and a set of heuristic rules. While it effectively captures clear positive and negative signals (handles negation and emoticons), its inability to disambiguate word meanings or interpret subtle contextual cues can lead to sentiment scores that do not always match the intended sentiment of the sentence.\n"
