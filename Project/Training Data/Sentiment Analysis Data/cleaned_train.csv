5020,"this is a rereview. this could be the best habit tracker, goal setter and task manager, with some really great features like nested lists and smartauto grouping and a very versatile repeat task setup. just don't confuse the 'game' in rpg for any actual gameplay but it does have a very elaborate character design and advancement system, that deserves recognition, allowing for a well rounded and unique hero which grows with every task performed in the user's daily life. however do it now does hamstring itself by overlooking some very important integral functionality. firstly there is no way to order the tasks set out in any of the groups. after a solid month of use, building some projects with subtasks which had subtasks, and setting up several habit based routines, the lack of prioritisation or task ordering created a confusing clutter of items which looked no different from the next. while autogrouping and smart grouping should have been able to help sort that out the lack of ability for the user to remove any task from these groups meant every task appeared, once again losing the important ones in the clutter. user defined groups could only contain the items specifically placed in them but once again a large project with a number of different aspects can not be ordered into a sensible linear series.. with no social aspect currently attached to the app as at ver 2.23.0 there is no task sharing. there is also no designated pcmaclinux front end for desktop syncing. finally it's expensive as apps go. a one off of 75 will get the full version, or about 2.50 a month paid yearly, which removes ads and gives calendar access. original review a good way to make the tedium of self regulation a bit more fun. being able to plan to skip things when away from regular activities is handy. it would be nice to see characteristic and skill based modifiers affect related task improvements as they raise and subtask attached leader.",1,neutral

671,would give 5 stars if it wasn't buggy and didn't cause me to miss a task. the calendar widget is a complete failure. it randomly removes some of the calendars that are synced and creates a duplicate of repeated tasks when they are marked as complete. the whole reason i subscribed to this app was because i needed to sync all my calendars and make my life easier by maintaining them all in one place and not miss any appointments or tasks. the app is useless if i can't rely on it to display and sync correctly. fix the bugs and i'll reinstall and change to 5 stars.,2,positive
